Assignments for CS2211

Forgot what each assignment was made to do, but was mostly learning the basics of system programming and C.

All of the uploaded files were coded in Visual Studio since I didn't want to code in command prompt (School instructions). Since I also needed to install a C complier, 
  I tried using minGW (https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/). Some lines of my code will not compile in VS, nor in VSCode, but they will run
  when uploaded to the school's GAUL. 
  
I most likely misinstalled minGW, but it wasn't that big of an issue since I just copy/pasted code to GAUL to run.
